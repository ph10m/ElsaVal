BlackRock -LRB- NYSE BLK  -RRB- CEO $T$ says in a letter to shareholders that In my 44 years in finance, I have never experienced anything like. expects that the economy will recover and sees tremendous opportunities after the economy recovers. As dramatic as this has been, I do believe that the economy will recover steadily, in part because this situation lacks some of the obstacles to recovery of a typical financial crisis, Fink wrote. He emphasizes the importance of taking a long-term view of markets. The world will get through this crisis. The economy will recover. And for those investors who keep their eyes not on the shaky ground at our feet, but on the horizon ahead, there are tremendous opportunities to be had in today's markets. Covid-19 has sparked a re-evaluation of many assumptions about the global economy, such as our infatuation with just-in-time supply chains. There are also significant challenges ahead for heavily indebted businesses.

The ministers will hold a teleconference on April 7 to discuss support against the epidemic, as requested by EU leaders last week, after a row over whether the euro zone should jointly issue debt in response to the health crisis.

EUROPEAN officials warned against loosening lockdowns after the novel coronavirus outbreak claimed more than 3,000 lives in Spain and Italy over the weekend. Strains in health-care systems increased as Spain said its intensive-care wards are stretched beyond capacity and a German public-health leader said the country may face a ventilator shortage. An ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel said public life in Europe's biggest economy will be restricted for at least several more weeks. With France, Italy and Spain calling for pooled euro-area financial resources to stem the economic cost and Germany opposing, $T$ are expected to discuss the way forward this week. Yet they can only do so much as governments in Europe's largest economies implore people to stay home. We need to reduce mobility and turn all of the days of the week into Sundays, Spanish Labour Minister Yolanda Diaz said on Sunday. The premise is that we all stay at home. Italy, which has the most Covid-19 deaths worldwide, reported 756 new fatalities on Sunday. Spain recorded 838, its highest daily number yet. Both countries together have more than five times the deaths reported by China, where the outbreak began. While the pace of fatalities and infections showed signs of levelling off in both countries, officials warned against complacency. Spain said its number of ICU patients surpassed the national capacity of about 4,400 beds, forcing healthcare workers to decide whom to treat first. Politicians anxious to relaunch Europe's economy sought to suggest a timeline for easing. Silvio Brusaferro, the head of Italy's public health institute, said the most recent figures offer encouraging signs, though any move to reopen the country will be gradual. The country's current restrictions will likely continue through Easter before the authorities assess any relaxation of the rules, Mr Brusaferro said in an interview with Monday's la Repubblica newspaper. We need to see an increase in the number .

Dubai is closing its famous malls and halting all passenger flights, capping a series of shutdowns on once-thriving sectors that serve as its economic lifeline but which have been sacrificed to curb coronavirus. A few days after barring foreigners, including those with residency permits, from entering the country, the emirate said it would close its airports to commercial flights, shut shopping centres and restrict restaurants to home deliveries. Within hours of the announcement, which will be enforced by Wednesday, the city's vast malls were already largely deserted, with corridors and concourses empty and shops devoid of customers. Boasting the most diversified economy in the Gulf, Dubai derives 94 percent of its public revenues from non-oil sources which also make up the majority of its gross domestic product. The city-state presents itself as a global hub for tourism, trade and finance, boasting one of the biggest real estate markets in the region. The glitzy emirate, which last year welcomed 16.8 million visitors, has now completely shut tourism outlets, directly impacting hundreds of hotels and countless dining and entertainment facilities the backbone of an economy already stressed by a downturn. Dubai carrier Emirates Airline, the biggest in the Middle East, transported some 90 million passengers last year, while Dubai Airport retained its status as the biggest for international passengers, serving 89 million travellers. In the wake of the airports announcement $T$ said it would suspend all passenger flights by March 25, and Abu Dhabi-based carrier Etihad said it would also temporarily halt all its flights to and from its home base. The UAE which takes in seven emirates including Dubai has so far announced a stimulus package worth $35 billion which includes injections into the stock market and support for various sectors.

Oil prices could possibly go negative, some analysts say, due to lack of demand amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and increased production due to a price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia. Paul Sankey, managing director at Mizuho Securities, told Fox Business earlier this month that oil companies might not be able to store all the oil that is being produced, and would pay buyers to take the commodity of their hands. The effect of negative oil prices would hurt the U.S. shale industry. President Trump instructed the Department of Energy to purchase oil for the reserves earlier this month but the U.S. government is still trying to determine how to finance the purchasing operation. The coronavirus has caused demand for oil to drop, as countries around the world have shut down non-essential businesses to prevent the spread of the disease. $T$ has urged Russia to cut production due to the drop in demand but Russia refused. Both countries have been increasing production of oil in a race for market share. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, however, have said that coronavirus is the bigger challenge for the oil industry, rather than the Russia-Saudi price war. Big Oil will consolidate the best assets in the industry and will shed the worst. when the industry emerges from this downturn, there will be fewer companies of higher asset quality, but the capital constraints will remain, the analysts wrote in a note on Monday. The oil price war is made irrelevant by the large decline in demand and has made a coordinated supply response impossible to achieve in time, the note continued. Oil is just one of the many struggling industries that may contribute to global economic fears. The coronavirus pandemic will likely cause a global recession, as cases continue to rise in major economies such as the U.S., Italy and Japan.

The government released new information on its wage subsidy program Monday, but many of the details including just how much the program will cost remain unanswered. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Friday the government would subsidize up to 75 per cent of an wages to help businesses retain workers and keep them on the payroll through the COVID-19 crisis. On Monday, Trudeau released new details of the program including that it would be open to a wide-swath of businesses with no cap on the number of employees. This is about making sure that people are still getting paid whether they work for a business that employs 10 people or a 1,000 people, he said. To qualify businesses must have a drop in revenue related to COVID-19 of at least 30 per cent. The government will cover 75 per cent of the first $58,700 a person earns, which works out to $847 per week. It will also be backdated to March 15. Half of Canadians say they are on brink of insolvency as coronavirus threatens to burst consumer debt bubble What the government is offering you in coronavirus-related benefits and how to get them How to protect your personal finances amid the coronavirus chaos The previous attempt at a wage subsidy program covered only 10 per cent of wages, but was also much more restrictive with a cap on the wage it would cover and the size of the business.

The government released new information on its wage subsidy program Monday, but many of the details including just how much the program will cost remain unanswered. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced Friday the government would subsidize up to 75 per cent of an wages to help businesses retain workers and keep them on the payroll through the COVID-19 crisis. On Monday, Trudeau released new details of the program including that it would be open to a wide-swath of businesses with no cap on the number of employees. This is about making sure that people are still getting paid whether they work for a business that employs 10 people or a 1,000 people, he said. To qualify businesses must have a drop in revenue related to COVID-19 of at least 30 per cent. The government will cover 75 per cent of the first $58,700 a person earns, which works out to $847 per week. It will also be backdated to March 15. $T$ say they are on brink of insolvency as coronavirus threatens to burst consumer debt bubble What the government is offering you in coronavirus-related benefits and how to get them How to protect your personal finances amid the coronavirus chaos The previous attempt at a wage subsidy program covered only 10 per cent of wages, but was also much more restrictive with a cap on the wage it would cover and the size of the business.

U.K. business confidence slumped in March as the coronavirus pandemic began to make its mark on companies, according to Lloyds Banking Group Plc. About three quarters of firms said they were already affected by the outbreak, or expected to be -- a level that likely underestimates the scope of the fallout, as the survey of 1,200 companies closed a week before the country was put into lockdown in an attempt to slow the rate of infection. Measures of economic optimism and hiring intentions declined, while sentiment was especially hard hit in the retail and services industries. Consumers also took a knock to their confidence at the start of the month, a separate report by GfK showed. Households became more pessimistic about their own finances and the economy overall, and they pulled back from planning major purchases. This research was carried out during the first two weeks of March, when the coronavirus was headline news but not impacting day-to-day lives, said $T$.

The Cabinet will approve $T$ Bill 2020 of Ministry of Finance on Tuesday -LRB- March 31 -RRB-, official sources told Business Recorder. As a signatory to the WTO's agreement on Trade Facilitation, Pakistan has notified establishment of ICT-based cross border trade related National Single Window -LRB- NSW -RRB- by February, 2022. The NSW is a facility that allows parties involved in trade and transport to lodge standardized information and documents with a single-entry point to fulfill all import, export and transit-related requirements. Implementation of NSW comprehensively improves ease of doing business in management of imports, exports and transit trade which is an area where Pakistan has been lagging. After having been designated as the lead agency by the Prime Minister, Pakistan Customs has conducted various studies with help of international and local experts in consultation with various stakeholders in public and private sector. A detailed project design document was approved by high level steering committee under chairmanship of the Advisor to Prime Minister on Finance and Revenue in August 2019. This design document recommended promulgation of a new law based on detailed legal gap analysis of existing laws and regulations related to cross border trade, most of which were found to be antiquated. The analysis also covered aspects provided in the approved governance, operation, revenue and functional models for PSW as well as in the checklist provided in the recommendation number 35 for establishing a legal framework for international trade single window. Pakistan Customs accordingly drafted PSW Act in compliance with the sub-rule 1 of rule 8 and sub-rule 18 of the Rules of Business, 1973 completed the consultative process with relevant Ministries and department. This process included circulation of the draft law, conducting a workshop, holding meetings, incorporating various suggestions and changes .

The Asian Development Bank -LRB- ADB -RRB- has approved a further $2 million grant to support the Government of efforts to combat the coronavirus -LRB- COVID-19 -RRB- pandemic in the country. The grant, financed from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund, will help fund the immediate purchase of emergency medical supplies, personal protective equipment, diagnostic and laboratory supplies, and other equipment. It supplements an initial $500,000 approved by ADB on 20 March which is already being deployed to support procurement of emergency supplies through UNICEF. Taken together, this $2.5 million in approved funding represents immediate response for $T$, with further support to follow. It is worth mentioning here that Pakistan has arranged about $4 billion additional financial assistance from multilateral lending and aid agencies to shore up foreign exchange reserves and budgetary support for fighting adverse impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. In $4 billion, the Asian Development Bank would provide $350 million immediately and a request had been made for another $900m disbursement by June this year to meet emerging needs. ADB recognizes the extraordinary burden of this pandemic on Pakistan and is committed to supporting Pakistan in the fight to control said ADB Country Director for Pakistan Xiaohong Yang. This grant will help strengthen COVID-19 detection, improve infection prevention and control, and boost capacity to respond to the pandemic. assistance echoes the World Health Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19 and National Action Plan for Corona Virus Disease -LRB- COVID-19 -RRB-, which includes preventive measures, containment efforts, and treatment of infected persons. Given the urgency of the required support, ADB will use the most flexible and expeditious approaches to facilitate procurement of the required medical supplies and equipment.

Africa is crying out for debt relief to weather a perfect storm of coronavirus, plummeting oil and commodity prices, mounting budget deficits and weaker currencies. But delivering the relief that would allow governments to pump resources into creaking healthcare systems and shield economies against the fallout from the pandemic is a tall order. When the International Monetary Fund -LRB- IMF -RRB- and World Bank launched their Heavily Indebted Poor Countries -LRB- HIPC -RRB- debt relief programme in 1996, African nations mainly owed money to wealthy countries and multilateral institutions. China's government, banks and companies lent some $143 billion to Africa between 2000 and 2017, according to Johns Hopkins University, and African governments have raised over $55 billion on international debt markets in the past two years, the culmination of a decade-long spree of Eurobond issues. Throw in debt held by other banks, commodity traders and even so-called vulture funds, and Africa's creditor landscape has become far more complex. That means debt relief frameworks of the past may fail to ease the pressure on government finances unless private lenders are flexible, bondholders consider waiving repayments or interest and China works closely with Western institutions that have often criticised its lending practices, experts say. The complicated structure makes it harder, undoubtedly. But let's do what we can, $T$, president of the Center for Global Development in Washington, told Reuters. A former IMF and World Bank official, Ahmed oversaw the development of the HIPC initiative and thinks those institutions need to secure a debt moratorium under the direction of the Group of 20 -LRB- G20 -RRB- major economies. Wealthy countries in lockdown to curb a pandemic that has killed more than 24,000 people worldwide are pumping trillions of dollars into their economies to combat the fallout. The G20 also said after an emergency .

The complicated structure makes it harder, undoubtedly. But let's do what we can, Masood Ahmed, president of the Center for Global Development in Washington, told Reuters.

Wealthy countries in lockdown to curb a pandemic that has killed more than 24,000 people worldwide are pumping trillions of dollars into their economies to combat the fallout. The G20 also said after an emergency .

$T$ is crying out for debt relief to weather a perfect storm of coronavirus , plummeting oil and commodity prices , mounting budget deficits and weaker currencies . But delivering the relief that would allow governments to pump resources into creaking healthcare systems and shield economies against the fallout from the pandemic is a tall order . When the International Monetary Fund -LRB- IMF -RRB- and World Bank launched their Heavily Indebted Poor Countries -LRB- HIPC -RRB- debt relief programme in 1996 , African nations mainly owed money to wealthy countries and multilateral institutions .

China 's government , banks and companies lent some $ 143 billion to $T$ between 2000 and 2017 , according to Johns Hopkins University , and African governments have raised over $ 55 billion on international debt markets in the past two years , the culmination of a decade - long spree of Eurobond issues .

Tower Resources PLC said Monday it has declared force majeure at its Thali project in $T$. Shares in Tower Resources closed 16 lower in London on Monday. Tower is still hoping to spud NJOM-3 before September 15. As a result of the force majeure, Tower has amended its heads of terms with OilLR Pty Ltd over the farm-out of 24.5 of Thali, extending the proposed completion date to June 30. Tower is satisfied that OilLR's intended investors have the funds to complete the intended farm-in, and both Tower and OilLR are still committed to completing the transaction, but both parties also agree that the transaction cannot be completed until the environment stabilises sufficiently for the project to move forward, the company added. Tower noted it is also continuing discussions with other potential investors in the Thali PSC, and while it fully expects OilLR to complete the agreed farm-in as set out in the heads of terms. Tower said The company has also agreed with OilLR that in the event it receives additional offers of firmly committed funds which aggregate to more than USD15 million, and if -LRB- and only if -RRB- OilLR is unable to make an escrow payment on an agreed schedule, then the company will have the right to reduce OilLR's share of the total farm-out down to a minimum of USD5 million to accommodate the other potential investors. Tower said this will ensure extending the completion schedule will not materially delay its access to funding from other sources. Tower Chair Jeremy Asher said We are glad that our partners at OilLR remain committed to the Thali project despite recent market upheavals and despite the operational delays required by the global response to the Covid-19 pandemic. As our recently released update to the Oilfield International Reserve Report has highlighted, the Thali project economics remain very attractive at current .

A former trade and economics adviser to President Donald Trump, Kelly Ann Shaw, is joining the law firm Hogan Lovells, she and a representative of the firm told Reuters. Shaw left the White House last fall after serving as Trump's G7 and G20 sherpa and as a member of the team advising the president on trade talks with China. She was one of the most senior women on his economic team. Shaw said she hoped the G7 and G20 groups of nations would rise to the challenge of tackling the coronavirus and she encouraged Trump to lift tariffs or grant exclusions on life-saving equipment in the short term. We would want to see health equipment and life saving equipment be able to get into the hands of the people who need it the most as quickly as possible, she said. $T$ and China have been engaged in a trade war for nearly two years, with tit-for-tat tariffs on each other's goods, though the two nations are currently seeking to negotiate the second phase of a trade deal. Shaw joins the firm on April 13 as a partner in its international trade and investment division. -LRB- Reporting by Jeff Mason Editing by Shri Navaratnam -RRB- Breaking news and analyses in your inbox skip all comments REUTERS2

Coronavirus $2 Trillion Stimulus Bill Explained What You Need To Know About The Historic Relief Package. Welcome to On the Street, my first column for Newsweek.com. Every Monday, I'll give you my take on major stories in the world of business and politics where it intersects with both. To save you a slog through LinkedIn, a little about me I'm editorial director of Newsweek. Previously, I have worked in jobs ranging from a reporter and columnist for the Wall Street Journal and the Boston Globe, respectively, to deputy editor at Fortune magazine. I'm also the author of You Can't Fire Everyone, a management memoir. -LRB- As it turns out, you can, I guess. -RRB- So let's get started. Lots of pandemic-related bailout stuff, obviously The 500 stock index closed up for the week last north of 10 on the news of the bailout, Fed moves and who-knows-what-else. For most of us, that shouldn't be a signal to get back in the stock pool or out for that matter. But if you have been reading the various financial sites, there have been a slew of articles encouraging investors to start investing again. Or prodding them to do it. For readers, pure stock porn. You know, here's what Warren Buffett may or may not be doing or saying. Or Goldman Sachs just loves Boeing. Or Bill Miller says the coronavirus bear market is one of the best buying opportunities ever. But you're not Miller, and you're not Buffett, and you have no idea whether the bailout is going to get the economy going again and when. There's a lot of irresponsible rubbish out there, in the guise of advice. But if you're a normal most of us some time with Newsweek 's $T$ on managing the ups and downs of the insane equity markets. My favorite point market timing is for dummies. Amen, Harris. So let me get this straight.

We face a frightening pandemic. More than 100,000 American have been infected with Covid-19, while tens of millions more continue to shelter at home. Meanwhile, the markets are crashing. And yet the more things change, the more they stay the same. While health care workers and local governments frantically race against the clock to keep up with the escalating medical caseloads while trying to keep themselves and their families safe, Congress was still able to find the time to give money away to rich people. Thanks to a stunning new report from the New York Times, which has been relentless on the tax beat during the $T$, we've learned that a provision has been included in the 880-page coronavirus stimulus bill to help the very wealthy in a way that is breathtaking in its scope and detail. It is worth taking a minute -- many of us have more of those now in our quarantined states -- to explain. When individuals buy real estate, even if they do so using loans or other people's money, they can depreciate -- or write off, over time -- the cost of the physical property on their taxes. Suppose, for example, that a taxpayer bought a $2 million building as an investment. He would be able to deduct, or subtract from his taxes, something like $100,000 a year for 20 years to defray the costs of buying and improving the property. The taxpayer would be able to take these deductions even if the building were going up in value. This is why Donald Trump loves depreciation, as he told the nation during a presidential debate in 2016 -- it's one of many ways he avoided paying millions in taxes. Such .

UK Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries said on Sunday that it could take $T$ about six months to see whether it can relax the partial coronavirus lockdown. Iain Begg, professor at the European Institute of the London School of Economics and Political Science, believes that the current situation is unprecedented and the British economy, like every other economy affected by COVID-19, is facing an uncertain future. Sputnik What's your assessment of the current state of the British economy Iain Begg We know there's going to be a sharp recession in the current quarter, we know that certain sectors are particularly severely hit, such as aviation or tourism, and some leisure activities, but nobody can predict at this stage how deep the recession will be and how long it will last. If the health crisis abates quickly, then it should be just a short sharp shock and we'd expect to see a rapid recovery. People have been talking about a V-shape recession when you fall very steeply and you rise very steeply afterwards. However, if it proves to be the case that the recession lasts longer than expected, then there's great uncertainty about how deep it will be and how damaging it will be to the sectors most badly affected. This is true not just for the British economy, but for every economy affected by the virus. Sputnik To what extent is it ready for such a shock Iain Begg It's unprecedented. It is unlike a financial crisis, where everybody at least knows how to deal with it, which is to pump money into the system and to recapitalise the banks.

Dow Jones By Alicia H. Munnell Easy answer most households have little savings, and many jobs provide little flexibility. A reporter called recently to ask why $T$ are using Twitter to plead for financial assistance during the coronavirus. The answer is that the coronavirus is shining a spotlight on the vulnerability of a wide swath of American households. Start with financial resources. In 2017, in the midst of the strong economic recovery, about 40 of households interviewed by the Federal Reserve's Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking -LRB- SHED -RRB- said that they would have trouble paying for a $400 unexpected expense. Yes, it's true that another Federal Reserve survey -- the Survey of Consumer Finances -LRB- SCF -RRB- -- shows only 20 literally have less than $400 in their bank accounts. But some households that have at least $400 in their bank accounts also have outstanding credit card debt of an equal or greater amount. Combine those households that have less than $400 in cash on hand with those that would have less than $400 in cash once they paid off their credit cards and the two surveys produce a very consistent picture -LRB- see figure 1 -RRB-. Many households simply do not have the resources to weather a small emergency -- much less a pandemic that might go on for months. In addition to virtually no financial buffer, most lower-paid workers don't have any ability to take time off from work if they get sick or are ordered to stay home. If they don't work, they don't get paid -LRB- see figure 2 -RRB-. These problems -- little financial buffer and no benefits at work -- have existed for decades, but the pandemic will drive home the financial vulnerability of millions and millions of Americans. -Alicia H.

The price of Brent crude will average $33.8 per barrel this year, and will then rise to $45.5 per barrel in 2021 amid recovery of global economy and oil demand, UK-based research agency Oxford Economics said on Monday. Saudi Arabia is maximizing oil deliveries and will continue this strategy thought the first half of 2021, adding to downward pressure from reduced oil demand, it said. Earlier in the day, Brent oil futures for delivery in May fell below $22 per barrel for the first time since March Oil prices halved since early March due to the expected demand slump after the breakup of the OPEC oil output cut deal and amid the coronavirus outbreak. After OPEC states failed to agree, $T$ officially announced an increase in oil shipments in April to 12.3 million barrels per day, 300,000 barrels per day higher than its production capacity, and reportedly started offering its oil to European customers with huge discounts. Weak demand and expected increase in shipments has sent price of Russian crude blend Urals to $16.2 per barrel, lowest in more than two decades. On Thursday, Norwegian research company Rystad Energy predicted daily global oil demand to fall in by 4.9 percent year-on-year to 95 million barrels. Your Thoughts and Comments

A group of leading economists say Germany, Europe's largest economy, will suffer a deep slump in the first half of this year but should rebound relatively quickly from the disruption of the virus outbreak. The German Council of Economic Experts predict that the economy will shrink 2.8 for the full year and rebound next year with growth of although their report issued Monday acknowledged a high degree of uncertainty about the length of the restrictive measures that have shut down much of the economy. The base scenario is a V-shaped recovery, with a sharp downturn and quick rebound. $T$ said that the downturn would be deeper but not longer than the recession following the global financial crisis a decade ago with a steep fall over the first six months followed by recovery. It is not like a war where the capital stock has been destroyed, meaning many businesses could quickly resume operations, he said, conceding that the uncertainty is immense. The report's alternative, more pessimistic scenarios include a deeper slump of 5.4 this year. Another scenario that assumes restrictive measures remain in place past the summer implies a slower recovery with a dip of 4.5 this year but only a 1.0 rebound in 2021. The council's report contrasts with a more pessimistic estimate from Munich's Ifo institute of a fall in output of 7.2 to 11.2 this year. The German economy shrank 5.7 in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis and the Great Recession but rebounded the year after.
