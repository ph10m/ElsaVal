U.S. stocks opened firmly higher on Thursday, extending a late-session rally from the prior session, as investors dialed back on fears that a trade spat between the U.S. and China will materialize. The major equity indexes staged a big turnaround Wednesday after opening sharply lower, as traders struggled to interpret the possible impact of the trade standoff on U.S. corporate earnings and growth. What are main benchmarks doing? Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ^DJI )rise rose about 150 points, or 0.6%, to 24,410.

So far this year, the S&P 500 has had three times as many sessions with a 1% move than it recorded in all of 2017. What’s driving markets Worries about trade hostilities between the two biggest economies in the world continued to ease. Stocks were battered initially on Wednesday after tit-for-tat tariffs on imports were announced by the U.S. and China. But now there will be shift to a period of negotiation, with the U.S. and China expected to spend six months in talks to resolve their trade differences. As well, speculation that the U.S. could survive even a protracted trade war is stoking some upbeat sentiment among investors.

For the first quarter 2018 reporting period, the estimated earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 is 17.3%.

      "Sending your child to study overseas means building a home away from home, you need to consider more than just university fees.. Stanley Tordiffe Investing offshore to secure your child's education. Picture: Supplied Since the beginning of the #FeesMustFall campaign in 2015, issues surrounding university fees and affordability have been under intense scrutiny by decision makers, prospective students and parents – who are more often than not, faced with the financial responsibility. Among other factors, the uncertainty created by this movement has contributed to a growing trend among those who have the means to send their children abroad to study. According to the 2017 Knight Frank Wealth Report nearly half of the respondents with clients in Africa, 47% strongly agreed that wealthy families are choosing to send their children overseas to get an education, while the global average is 28%. The move by parents to send their children to study abroad is nothing untoward. This is a natural trend as international travel is far cheaper than before, and together with technology, the internet and social media, it is making the world far more integrated and a global village. Amid global volatility and change in both the political and financial spheres, financial literacy and planning for your child’s education should remain a priority. However, like any major financial decision, you need to consider a multitude of factors when deciding whether to send your children overseas for their education. Universities South Africa (USAf), the representative body of South Africa’s public universities, has granted South African universities an 8% fee increase for 2018. While not all universities have adopted the increase, the threat of fee hikes must be considered when calculating the costs involved with higher education.” The approximate cost for a three-year BCom degree at the University of Cape Town (UCT) is around R169 900 per annum, including tuition, accommodation and other relevant costs. UCT is one of the more expensive universities in South Africa, but it is also important to note that you will pay different amounts for different courses. An Engineering or Medical Degree, for example, will cost more than other degrees. So, a more expensive degree at one of the less expensive local universities will likely be similar in cost overall. Based on a comparison of three offshore universities, namely the University of Western Australia in Perth, Oxford in England and Harvard in USA, the annual average cost for an offshore university per annum including living expenses such as groceries, accommodation – ranging from renting a flat, living in res or communal housing, and entertainment, can range between a minimum of R 346 216 per annum – for lower end choices – to R1.1 million per annum at Harvard University. The costs for tuition and accommodation will undoubtedly be the main costs associated with university, however studying abroad involves recreating a home away from home for your children. Related expenses like accommodation, meals, entertainment, flights and other expenses have to be included. There are many other expenses to consider when sending your child to live overseas whilst studying,” explains Tordiffe. You also need to consider your child’s living standards as an international student. Will it be at a higher cost or will they have to adjust to a cheaper cost of living? When making the necessary provision, Tordiffe says that possible rand currency fluctuations must be considered and planned for accordingly. If the rand had to weaken significantly and you are saving in rands, it would mean you would be short in your savings goal. Therefore, it makes sense to have your savings aligned to the nature of the offshore goal by investing offshore and thereby hedging out the currency risk as early as possible in your savings plan. Education planning is only one of the goals you need to consider in your financial plan. Investors should look at their financial plan in relation to their lifestyle and decide how much they are going to allocate to education planning. To do this, you need to have a clear understanding of what is important to you and what your desired lifestyle and goals are – you can’t look at any one aspect in isolation. These goals also need to include the likes of your travel, recreation, home, car and retirement goals. By completing the full circle and determining all your lifestyle goals, you will be able to determine the level of investment return that is required for each goal, including your child’s education, based on your current financial circumstances.

      "National elections are scheduled for May 2019, and may happen sooner. I have often said, to anyone willing to listen, that fake news was “invented” in India long before making its way to the shores of that other great democracy.. National elections are scheduled for May 2019, and may happen sooner. I have often said, to anyone willing to listen, that fake news was “invented” in India long before making its way to the shores of that other great democracy. In India, we can date the event to the surprisingly large win by the Narendra Modi led BJP in May 2014. The rationale behind fake news (and in my view, its more important first cousin, fake analysis) is to create a political atmosphere helpful to the (weak) challenger. Conventional wisdom says that the challenger is in trouble—so, change the basis of this wisdom—provide facts “alternate” to the prevailing reality. Indeed, the father of fake news/analysis was Goebbels, who reasoned that if you incessantly repeat a lie, the lie will become “reality”. With the explosion of social media, the instrument, and practice, has changed over the years. But the reality is the same—change people’s perceptions is the mantra. This is what has been happening over the last few years in India, and is now reaching a crescendo because national elections are approaching. There is a not so subtle attempt by Modi’s political opponents to create a chorus around both the political and economic reality. The emphasis around the word chorus is important; just one person saying the alternate reality is inconsequential, several emphasising the alternate reality (op-eds, Facebook, WhatsApp ) can create a flood, and possibly change reality? I provide some evidence below—the reader can make her own judgments about whether more proof is needed! Politics: The evidence is considered overwhelming. BJP lost in two Lok Sabha (LS) by-polls in Rajasthan, and did so by a large margin. This was followed up by an important LS by-poll victory, for the Samajwadi Party candidate, supported by Mayawati, in Uttar Pradesh’s Gorakhpur seat that was vacated by chief minister Yogi Adityanath. Add to this the fact that a no-confidence motion is being introduced, and we have confirmation that Modi’s BJP is in danger of obtaining less than 200 seats in the next general election. Remember also the fact that the day before counting in May 2014, the conventional wisdom, often championed by the same commentators as today, was that the election would result in a hung parliament. The story cannot have any ambiguity. The opinionatti fail to mention that over the course of the last four years, the BJP (and/or its allies) has continued to win all elections it has contested barring Delhi and Bihar. The BJP and its allies now rule in 22 of the 29 states in India, a record for any ruling coalition in India’s 68-year democratic history. (India became a Republic with the adoption of a Constitution on January 26, 1950). The previous record was 18 states held by the Congress, under Indira Gandhi. Our “liberal elite” would have us believe that because of Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav getting together for one by-poll in UP, that electorally the BJP is in danger of losing control. Yet, a few days later, the same electoral combine fails to win a Rajya Sabha seat—because a BSP legislator walked over to the BJP side! This is not considered important. Not considered relevant to the chorus byline is the BJP victory in Tripura and the rule (with allies) in Meghalaya and Nagaland. Would any member of the elite have considered this even possible just a year ago? No. Also, Congress experts point out that the BJP went on to face horrific defeat in the Rajasthan by-polls. True. But, in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, in Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia’s own backyard, the Congress won by just 2,000 votes in Mungaoli versus a victory margin of 58,000 votes in the 2013 state election. Politics is uncertain, and so reasonable women can disagree. Economics is more certain, but this isn’t stopping the chorus from claiming that the reason Modi is in trouble is because economic conditions are no better, and possibly worse, than 2014.Some claim that he had promised large scale privatisation of the economy. Since that hasn’t happened, Modi has failed. But Air India is being privatised, again not thought conceivable, let alone possible. Some difference surely from the inglorious past? Corruption same as before? Just look at the PNB scam. But that started in the scam-scam years of the UPA. That doesn’t negate the fact that it continued under Modi. True. But what if the BJP takes the bold (and sensible) decision to get at the root cause of banking scams—begin to unravel Indira Gandhi’s decision to nationalise the banks—and the creation of large-scale corruption? No matter what criteria (fiction) is cooked up, the fact remains that corruption at the highest levels has been radically reduced—and there seems to be an urgency to solve the problem.

China’s president Xi Jinping has a successor—himself. With this, Xi has re-stated the old dictum—now, political mandate is the basis of the economic mandate. The reactions to China’s recent constitutional amendments scrapping the two-term limit for the President (and Vice-President), ensconcing ‘Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era’ as fundamental law and the ‘leadership of the Communist Party of China as the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics,’ have ranged from mockery to disbelief to indifference. Chinese netizens showed their teeth, briefly. On the heels of the announcement, China’s netizens had a field day with clever puns and memes lampooning the decision. One social media image said something to the effect, ‘find the thing you love, and stick with it.’ Another rephrased a birth control advertisement saying that ‘twice is not enough’. All these came to an end when China’s sophisticated surveillance apparatus of ‘Little Pinks,’ (self-proclaimed patriots), ‘50 cent army’ (netizens on the Communist Party’s payroll) and clampdown on China’s microblogs took over with a ban on suggestive words and phrases such as ‘ascend’ and ‘Xi Zedong.’ But, many on the street, mostly the younger generation, continue to be appalled by the decision. “I’m worried, because if the Constitution could be easily changed, anything else can,” said a young corporate to this author. But, many of China’s laobaixing (China’s common man), much like India’s common man, couldn’t care less. “What matters to me is my daily bread and butter, not politics,” said another, shrugging his shoulders. In the last hundred years, China’s political trajectory has undergone shifts —from Qing dynasty to the nationalists (1921), to the communist revolution (1949). Famously, despite their changing dispositions, these political shifts have unanimously claimed the Chinese Mencian (later Confucian) concept of the ‘mandate of heaven’ (tian ming) or ‘legitimacy to rule.’ China’s rulers, emperors to the ‘new emperors’ (the Communists) have sought refuge in ‘divine rights’ to promise of ‘dictatorship of the proletariat’ to recently, economic moorings. All claim legitimacy because of the pursuit of China’s greater good—the goals of ‘fu’ (rich) and ‘qiang’ (strong), the magic words in China’s political lexicon. China’s Mao Zedong (1949-1976) interpreted the same by centralisation and extolling people to ‘eat bitterness’ for the sake of a better tomorrow—resulting in land reforms, birth control, uptick in literacy and control of common diseases. Mao’s successor, Deng Xiaoping (1904-1997) interpreted the same by distancing from the Maoist legacy of political repression. Deng moved with the times, loosening the state grip on citizens, marking the ‘retreat of the state.’ Deng’s logic was that a small measure of political liberalism and a largesse of economic reforms would lift all boats. Deng’s legacy evolved over the years with improvisations, additions into a norm, thus, establishing ‘quasi-formal’ political institutionalisation, largely in operation today. Xi has turned a new page, with Xi’s current model interpreting legitimacy in a new manner, in the ‘new era’. This may have been done at the cost of Deng’s prized legacy, which is rather ironical, given that China will be celebrating 40 years of Deng’s economic reforms and 40 years of smooth transition of power, both no mean feats, this year (1978-2018). Xi’s current model is a peculiar mix that incorporates both Mao and Deng. Called by observers as ‘Neo-Authoritarianism 2.0,’ it is best described as an ‘enhanced Deng Xiaoping model’ of ‘Mao measures’ (politically repressive, including the making of a personality cult) walking on the ‘Deng road’ (economically progressive) with ambitious economic goals. As for the Xi in the political mould of Mao—centralisation has taken the form of institutional titles that Xi has taken upon himself. TIME (2016) called Xi, ‘Chairman Xi’, attributing the same to a personality-cult-in-the-making. Much in the manner of Mao’s ‘red book’, Xi’s ‘blue book’ is doing rounds. Xi has a fan club (‘Learning from the Xi Fan Club’ with more than 2 million members). A series of articles by Zhexin (the penname of Xi) is being actively promoted. And, songs that eulogise Xi, including one that says, ‘Grandfather Xi is our Friend’, are reverberating in small towns. Xi is also China’s new ‘Uncle’—‘Xi Dada’ casting him as an accessible, benign patriarch. The rationale for Xi’s strong leadership is attributed to China’s bureaucratic and administrative delays and China’s peculiar vertical and horizontal lines of control (tiao and kuai, top-down and local), which may scuttle economic goals. China has not been able to ‘protect 7’ — 7% growth, and has shifted to a ‘new normal’ of slower, but ...\n",

      "Home &gt;&gt; General News &gt;&gt; BISP, Uber Pakistan ink MoU for provision of 100 vehicles, rickshaws for BISP beneficiaries. ISLAMABAD: Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) has signed an understanding with Uber Pakistan for creation of a large-scale economic opportunity program for BISP beneficiaries. A pilot project comprising of 100 BISP beneficiaries will be launched in Karachi, Lahore Rawalpindi and Islamabad with 25 beneficiaries from each city. The understanding focuses on creation of economic opportunities for women beneficiaries by providing them electronic/hybrid vehicles and CNG rickshaws by Uber Pakistan. The main focus of the partnership will be kept on inclusion of women beneficiary drivers in the programme for women empowerment. The vehicles will be supplied without any down payment and it will include interest free loan with target instalment of Rs 8,000 monthly for five years repayment for BISP Beneficiaries. Similarly, for rickshaws, interest free loan with target instalment of Rs 5,000-8,000 monthly, for five years repayment for BISP Beneficiaries. Secretary BISP Omar Hamid Khan stated that he was particularly excited about this MoU as this will take forward BISP beneficiaries in terms of technology as well as women empowerment. It will consist of asset transfer of Rickshaws and Vehicles on zero collateral & zero interest and easy instalments to selected beneficiaries. This partnership will help women entrepreneurs acquire requisite skills for driving and complete associated licensing requirements for rickshaws and other modes of transport, as well as other trainings that enhance candidates’ digital literacy, operational excellence, entrepreneurship skills, communication and customer care abilities. The MOU was signed Friday at BISP HQs in the presence of Chairperson BISP MNA Marvi Memon, Minister for State for Communications M. Junaid Anwar Chaudhary and Minister of State for Industries and Production Sardar Arshad Khan Leghri. Chairperson BISP MNA Marvi Memon termed it as follow-up of meeting between Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Dara Khowsroshahi, CEO of Uber Technologies Inc. at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos in January 2018. She said that it is an important initiative as BISP has credible data of most vulnerable women in the society who could be provided respectable earning opportunities through this. Ms. Memon further said, “The safety, security and dignity of BISP beneficiaries are most important to us.” She hoped that the partnership would help BISP beneficiaries exit the poverty trap. Speaking on the occasion, Chaudhary termed it as a unique and innovative partnership while congratulating the management of BISP. He said that, “It will be a game changer for rickshaw and taxi services in Pakistan.” He further added that the partnership should be replicated in other smaller cities, if it is successful in the major cities. The minister also offered the driver’s learning and licensing by Motorway Police to the beneficiaries of this partnership. Under this partnership, a pilot project will be conducted to test run the potential of Uber for benefit of BISP beneficiaries. Speaking on the occasion, General Manager of UBER in Pakistan, Safee Shah said: “Uber is working closely with the BISP to develop a framework for on-demand transportation technology aggregator services that will drive economic opportunities for women in Pakistan. We see BISP as a crucial partner in providing such opportunities and a key government entity in driving the sustainable economic empowerment model in Pakistan.” It will also include training of selected beneficiaries regarding road safety, security, health, nutrition etc. by tagging in different training agencies with the BISP beneficiaries targeted by the programme, said a press release.

      "New Hampshire regulators have issued a written ruling denying a power project over concerns it would harm tourism and property values.. The ruling Friday by the Site Evaluation Committee came two days after Massachusetts abandoned plans to get its clean energy from the $1.6 billion Northern Pass project, which would take hydropower from Canada and transmit it across New Hampshire. Energy company Eversource says it remains committed to the project despite the Massachusetts decision. It has requested a rehearing at the Site Evaluation Committee, which is expected as early as May. The committee in its written decision acknowledges Northern Pass offers economic benefits but says they aren't enough to overcome concerns about negative impacts to communities along the project's path.\n",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency is considering a rollback of emissions regulations and fuel economy standards put in place during the Obama Administration, the New York Times reported Thursday.. Measures requiring auto makers to achieve an average fleet fuel efficiency of 50 miles per gallon by 2025 were created to reduce emissions that cause climate change, but car companies have protested them for years. In late February 2017, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents General Motors, Toyota, Volkswagen, and nine other automakers, sent a letter to EPA head Scott Pruitt calling the fuel efficiency rules “the product of egregious procedural and substantive defects” that are “riddled with indefensible assumptions, inadequate analysis and a failure to engage with contrary evidence.” In March 2017, the Trump Administration ordered a review of the Obama-era regulations. Pruitt has already submitted a 16-page plan to the White House for approval, according to an EPA spokeswoman. He is expected to frame the deregulation as a move that will make larger vehicles, like trucks, vans, and sport utility vehicles, more affordable, say people familiar with the plan. This poses a solution to a problem that doesn’t seem to exist, since trucks and SUVs are routinely top-selling vehicles in the U.S., with the mid-size SUVs and pickup trucks accounting for 55% of all vehicle sales in 2017, according to Kelly Blue Book. The Ford F-series was the best-selling vehicle in the world last year, and has been the top-seller in the U.S. for more than 30 years. It’s a move that could actually damage the auto industry. “Rolling back fuel-efficiency and emissions targets would make zero sense economically for anyone but oil companies,” says David Richardson, the executive director of business development at Impax Asset Management. “In fact, it would set back American car companies and those working for them because the global automotive market is moving the opposite direction, away from gas guzzlers and toward cleaner, more efficient cars and associated technology.” Component suppliers would also take a hit. These companies employ twice as many Americans as the automakers they service and contribute nearly 2.4% of U.S. GDP. Weakened standards could cause losses of $3.3 billion a year between 2022 and 2025 due to lost sales of fuel-efficient technologies, according to analysis by Ceres, a sustainability nonprofit organization. The rollback of Obama-era EPA regulations will set off yet another legal standoff between the federal government and the state of California. California, which is already engaged in more than 25 court battles with the Trump Administration over issues including immigration, the 2020 census, transgender military service, healthcare, and environmental concerns, will sue to maintain the fuel efficiency standards the state has created. California has a special waiver that allows it to impose stricter air pollution standards under the 1970 Clean Air Act. This could lead to two separate sets of regulations — one for California and the 12 other states that will follow suit in challenging the EPA’s decision and one for the rest of the country — and therefore two separate markets of car buyers. Economists and climate change scientists have said that even the fuel efficiency standards currently in place at the EPA are not effective enough. “The current fuel economy standards do not create much incentive for people to move to smaller vehicles,”Lucas Davis, a professor of economic analysis at UC Berkeley told Fortune. “That’s a real limitation of the way the current fuel economy standards work.”\n",
